/*
Autocomplete System - Feature Specification

Functionality:
--------------
1. Word Suggestion with Prefix Matching:
   - Users can enter a prefix and choose the sorting order for suggestions.
   - The system traverses the trie/subtree from the prefix node to generate suggestions.
   - Sorting options:
     a. Frequently searched terms appear first. (Default)
     b. Shortest words first (BFS-based).
     c. Lexicographical order (DFS-based).

2. Dictionary Management:
   - Add a Word:
      User inputs a new word to be added to the dictionary.
   - Delete a Word:
      User can input an exact word for deletion, OR
      Enter a prefix and select the desired word from a list of matches.

3. Dynamic Dataset Expansion:
   - Track word usage frequency.
   - Automatically add user-typed words to the dictionary once they've been used 3 or more times.

4. Robustness & User Experience:
   - Case Insensitivity:
      System treats uppercase and lowercase inputs the same (e.g., "Car" == "car").
   - Exact Match Highlighting:
      If the user's input matches a word exactly, that word is highlighted in the suggestions.
   - Error Handling:
      Gracefully handle invalid characters or unsupported inputs.
      Manage empty/null inputs without crashing.

    Before we make the GUI, we'll have some primitive input system, like this:
    
    1 - Find word prefixes
    2 - Add word
    3 - Delete word/word prefix
    4 - Change word sorting order
    5 - Exit
